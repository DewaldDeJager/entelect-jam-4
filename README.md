# entelect-jam-4
The official repository for the asset jam on 24 February 2018

We'll be making an 8-bit top-down racing game. A palette should be available on this repository very soon to keep the assets in a similar style. To join fork this repository and upload your assets in a folder with your name (just so that we can avoid binary files being overridden) and submit a pull request once you're done. The jam starts at 9 am and concludes at 5 pm. Happy jamming everyone!
